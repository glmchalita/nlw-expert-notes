Thank you [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) for another super fun project to follow. Despite being simple, I was able to learn new features of Tailwind CSS and had the opportunity to get to know this library, Sonner, which is very easy to use and provides more interactivity with the client.
